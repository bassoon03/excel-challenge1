This contains the set of six spreadsheets with all the data tables and charts. It also contains a word document that covers conclusions drawn from the data, limitations of the data, suggested additions, and the 
statistical analysis. I'm not confident that the conclusions are anything but observations, and I don't know if they have any meaning. There may be some overlap between the various sections. Because my third pivot
table was constructed only recently, my conclusions are based on just the first two pivot tables and their corresponding charts.
